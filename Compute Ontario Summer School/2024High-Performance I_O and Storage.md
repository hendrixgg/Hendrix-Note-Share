### Description
This workshop will help you understand the relation between storage systems and application-level performance. We will survey the design of storage found on national systems, and consider their performance implications. A range of different IO techniques, data formats, and libraries will be considered. Ideally, participants should have an account on the National Platform (DRI). Level: intermediate, examples/exercises will be in Python; having a DRAC account will be helpful.
- **Level**: Intermediate
