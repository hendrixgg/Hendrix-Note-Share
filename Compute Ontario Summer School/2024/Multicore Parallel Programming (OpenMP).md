### Description
This is an introduction to the intermediate level OpenMP hand-on course. OpenMP is a standard parallel programming API that supports multi-platform shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran.
This one-day course will cover the principles of OpenMP compiler directives, library routines, and environment variables with step-by-step hand-on examples. Case studies include various approaches for loop parallelism. We will also talk about the Task constructs for irregular programs, and the Target constructs for accelerators such as GPU. Participants will have hand-on programming experience with OpenMP as well as how to compile and run Multi-thread OpenMP code on different alliance clusters.
- **Level**: Introductory
- **Length**: Two 3-Hour Sessions
- **Format**: Lecture + Hands-on (Hands-on portion is CPU only.)
