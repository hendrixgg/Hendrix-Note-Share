### Description
This workshop is a primer for those largely new to supercomputing, i.e., to computing on shared, remote resources. It is intended to demystify the somewhat intimidating term "High-Performance Computing" (HPC), and to serve as a foundation upon which to build over the coming days. Topics will include motivation for HPC, available resources, essential issues, and a high level overview of parallel programming models commonly used on these systems.
- **Level**: Introductory 
- **Length**: 3 Hours
