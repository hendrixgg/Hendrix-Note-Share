### Description
Machine learning is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans and animals: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to “learn” information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. In this hands-on introductory workshop, you will learn how to apply Machine Learning, and get familiar with the basics of Deep Learning. MATLAB provides an environment to apply advanced techniques without requiring extensive coding nor experience in machine learning.


Learn the fundamentals of machine learning  (supervised learning, feature extraction, and hyperparameter tuning)


Explore pre-processing and powerful visualization techniques


Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification and regression of various data formats (signals, images, text)


Perform hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to optimize model performance


Discuss interoperability with other platforms


Learn how to deploy Machine Learning models
