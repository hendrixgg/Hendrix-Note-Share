### Description
Modern C++ is an efficient, versatile programming language. This workshop will focus on the following in both sequential and parallel contexts:


using pseudo-random number generators,


making use of reduction options using underlying sequential code,


making simple use of in-situ code benchmarking/profiling, and,


using mdspan for accessing multi-dimensional arrays and multi-dimensional array slices (submdspan).


By the end of these sessions, one will have learnt about sequential and parallel uses of:


C++ pseudo-random number generators and their use,


C++ std::reduce(), std::transform_reduce(), etc. and C++ parallel algorithms and some of their uses and caveats,


using std::chrono facilities, e.g., for in-situ benchmarks, and,


how to use multi-dimensional arrays and slices in C++ code.


- **Level**: Intermediate
- **Length**: Four 3-Hour Sessions (2 Days)
- **Format**: Lecture + Hands-on
- **Prerequisites**: 


Experience developing sequential code in C++.

(The C++ programming language is not the C programming language. Experience is expected programming in C++, e.g., using the standard library's containers, iterators, and algorithms.)
