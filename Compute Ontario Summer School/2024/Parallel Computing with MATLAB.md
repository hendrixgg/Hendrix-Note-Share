### Description
During this hands-on workshop, we will introduce parallel and distributed computing in MATLAB with a focus on speeding up application codes and offloading compute. By working through common scenarios and workflows using hands-on demos, you will gain a detailed understanding of the parallel constructs in MATLAB, their capabilities, and some of the common hurdles that you'll encounter when using them.  Users will learn:


Multithreading vs multiprocessing


When to use parfor vs parfeval constructs


Creating data queues for data transfer


Leveraging NVIDIA GPUs


Parallelizing Simulink models


Working with large data
