### Description
In this workshop, we will explore the potential uses of generative artificial intelligence tools in research data management (RDM) with a focus on specific use cases. For example, can AI tools be used to write Data Management Plans, summarize funder requirements, assist with data analysis, or suggest file naming conventions and folder structures? This workshop will be interactive, and participants will be welcome to practice using AI tools along with the presenters using real-world data and prompts. We will also discuss the ethical considerations, including benefits and risks, of using AI tools in research and whether it is possible to use AI for RDM practices in an ethical manner.
