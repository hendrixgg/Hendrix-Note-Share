## How to set Work in Progress limits
https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban/pull/620
these are optional and you just append the limit number in brackets to the end of the column title, example: `In Progress (5)`. this will show up as having a title of just `In Progress` and the limit will be shown at the number.
