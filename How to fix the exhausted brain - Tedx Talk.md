speaker:
- guy named [[Brady Wilson]]


core ideas:
- know: ask people what is important to them - understand what they value
- identify: potential for that important thing happening - identify potential sources of value
- act: collaborate and make progress towards that goal - actualize potential value
- these qualities of a relationship make people energized rather than depleted
- my add-on: doing those three things makes your relationship into a ***master mind*** - where the whole (the partnership) becomes greater than the sum of the parts

Notes on ted talk:
- starts with a story when speaker was 9 years old
    - his brothers fought and never spoke, they communicated through speaker
    - same thing happened with brother kicked out of house, speaker brought cinnamon buns from mom to kicked out brother
- example with person at company - Paula
    - started out engaged and high-energy
    - stopped receiving training
    - became exhausted
    - dedicated but depleted
- why does brain become exhasted?
    - brain burns 20% of energy reserves each day
    - more energy than any other organ
- what do you lose when depleted?
    - executive function is lost
- what is exectuive function? - high-level brain function
- energized brain
    - focusing attention
    - regulating emotions
    - noticing connections
    - predicting outcomes
    - make smart decisions
- depleted brain
    - distracts your attention
    - reacts impulsively
    - loses the thread/train of thought
    - can't see implications
    - makes unwise decisions
- back to paula
    - new manager zied
    - realize that paula is depleted (when she is on her game, does really well, but usually she's super tired)
    - what manager asks her: "what can we take off your plate?"
    - this is bad because this is taking parenting approach, need to do partnering approach
    - parenting and trying to "fix" can be more depleting
- figure out what matters most in each situation
    - it can vary significantly by person and situation
- zied thought freedom what the important thing, that's why he offered to "take things off paula's plate" to free up her brain
- actually paula valued significance over freedom
- way to figure this out is to ask: "what matters most to you in this situation?"
- possibility flows from identifying what matters most
- my idea: when you share what matters most with a person, you create a master mind where your results are greater than the sum of your individual work

- how to energize people's brains?
    - get them doing what they think is most important
    - connection between people releases oxytocin which is chemical in brain that produces a sense of trust and bonding
    - sensing possibility, dopamine is released in brains: sparking motivation, creativity, goal orientation. 
    - we feel pleasure when we make progress - seratonin is released. partnering with someone
- connecting on what matters most - oxytocin
- identify possibility - dopamine
- work together and make progress - seratonin

- he gave another example with his son almost dying in a car crash
    - one friend responded saying "you know what i did ..." - this slack-jawed the speaker because it seemed that his friend didn't care about his son, sapping mental energy. speaker had coffee with this friend later, told him about crash and told his friend how he responded. speaker identified that friend had in mind building rapport as the important thing even before taking the call, so he wasn't really listening attentively.
    - another friend, when told of the car crash asked "what was it like the first time you saw your son again?" and the speaker felt extremely energized after getting asked this, he told him how he felt. This question showed a shared feeling of importance about almost losing a son between the speaker and friend.
