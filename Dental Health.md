## How Our Ancestors had WHITE TEETH with no Toothbrush? — They Used Chewing Sticks

takeaways:
- old (before farming and sugar) ancestors did not use [[Fluoride]] and had healthy teeth
- Eat primarily animal based diet
- try using Miswak sticks for cleaning teeth
    - miswak sticks are used by Muslims around the world, I over did it and needed fillings from over scrubbing. You need to soak the sticks really well to soften them up. 
        - We use rose water. I was amazed when I moved to Saudi Arabia the great teeth people have here especially in rural areas. People still eat traditional foods - fresh organic dates, camel and goat milk, ghee, millet, camel meat, goat meat, raw vegetables, honey, black seeds/black seed oil, a lot of herbs and spices. They drink coffee like fish drink water but the coffee here is different, its yellow, lightly roasted which they believe is an anti oxidant and anti parasitic. People spend a lot of time out doors, chew frankincense resin and also eat an array of fresh fruits - pomelos, watermelon, pomegranates, figs, grapes. They wash their mouths before and after eating, before praying 5 times a day. There are miswak bushes all over the place, the smell of the surrounding sand is incredible. They would laugh their asses off at hearing about fluoridated miswak, they wouldn't touch it with a barge pole. BTW the people of the region especially the women are abundant in breath taking beauty.
- Neem sticks (from [[India]])
