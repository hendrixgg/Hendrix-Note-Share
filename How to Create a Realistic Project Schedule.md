1. Prepare a [[Schedule Management Plan]].
2. Set milestones for project start and end dates.
3. Add an official "holidays calendar" for each resource based on their location.
4. Add resources (or real people) and their availability.
5. Add known vacations and days off for all team members.
6. Set milestones when new resources should be available.
7. Import a list of tasks (if you didn't use a scheduling tool for decomposition).
8. Assign resources to each task.
9. Identify dependencies.
10. Set durations for each task (copy the estimates provided by the team).
11. Identify a critical path.
12. Do a sanity check. Will you meet the deadline? You should have a 10-15% buffer.
13. Move the [[Work Package]]s around so they are being done in parallel. Or assign more resources to do the work faster. Or negotiate to de-scope something.
14. Check workload for resources. People should not go over their daily working hours.
15. Adjust the schedule and resources until you fit into the deadline. Or prove that it's impossible. Provide the next-best alternatives.
16. Subject your project schedule to [[Risk Management Process]] activities.
17. Add new risk response plans to the overall plan.
18. Again, move the [[Work Package]]s around so they are being done in parallel. Or assign more resources to do the work faster. Or negotiate to de-scope something.
19. Check workload for resources. Validate the whole project schedule (talk to people in [[Stakeholder Register Template]]).
20. Repeat steps 1-19 until you have a realistic project schedule that you and your team believe in.
21. Finalize the project schedule baseline.
