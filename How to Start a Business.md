Business Development (my idea):
1. decide on [[Spiritual Holding Company]] (core values/mission that you wish to uphold, requires [[Mission Model Canvas]])
2. choose initial customer area and value proposition area (use [[Value Proposition Design]] and [[#How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas Startup School]])
3. conduct preliminary research ([[Customer Development]] by [[Steve Blank]])
4. create initial [[Business Model]] (use [[Business Model Generation]])
5. test [[Business Model]] (use [[Testing Business Ideas]], [[The Four Steps to the Epiphany]], and [[The Startup Owner’s Manual]])
6. incorporate results of the test, result in an updated [[Business Model]], use stuff on pivots [[Pivoting Strategy]]
7. test again (go back to step 4)

He started a niche business in broadcasting.

Nighttime job at radio station producing shows.

He made them a better website.

Then he got to produce shows in the evening hours in return.

Building broadcasting business during the day.

- Cold calling people telling them they could get more time on television 
- Cold calling was super important. This is sales. Sales is simply connecting two people to make exchange of value.

How to grow as an entrepreneur
- poor blame the rich for being rich, but the poor advise you to stay normal
- Being an entrepreneur is not normal
- Surrounded by people going to bars, you’re not going to be successful.
- People are only aware about what is around them

Learn your flaws
- delegate

Example: don’t suffer fools, don’t get 
- solutions: don’t push through things, go around them

Learn from:
- people building for a long time
- People who are builders 
- People who have a good track record

Everything You Need to Know About Lean Startup in 12 Minutes

- a startup is not the same as a large company
- For a startup to succeed, you must turn faith into facts as quick as possible
- Facts are outside, go outside 

A startup is: “A temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.”
- write down all your guesses/hypotheses on the [[Business Model Canvas]] (by Alexandar Osterwalder?). His book is called “Business Model Generation”
- go test your hypotheses outside in the world (answer a bunch of questions about your business model)
- Agile engineering to build proof of concepts to test each aspect of the product, then ultimately a minimum viable product

Two ways to do this
- start with a new invention, go and find customers
- Start with understanding customers, go and find products

Either way, you need to find product-market fit. Some evidence that customers like your vision.

To be a good entrepreneur, investors Care about:
- what did you think at first?
- What did you find?
- What did you do?
- Where are you now?

A proof of concept (speaker calls it a Minimum viable product) is: build something that you can use to learn the most at a certain point of time.

## Everything they teach at Stanford about startups in under 1 hr

What is the purpose of an MBA (Masters in Business Administration)?
- to know how to run an existing business
- But a startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model

Startups are built around a series of untested guesses.

MBA have a set of tools for executing business plans. 

Lean startup has another set of tools:
- [[Business Model Canvas]] by Alexander Osterwalder
- Customer development by Steve Blank (speaker)
- [[Agile Engineering]] is the best way to build MVPs and POCs
- More

Product first, then find customer? Or customer first, then find product?
You can start on either end. (Tech focused people tend to start with product first, e.g. Semiconductors)

I’m still of the opinion that it is always customer first, however, thinking on the product side first may give you ideas of where to help customers.

And the end of the day, just aim for [[Product-Market Fit]]. (Evidence that test your guess)

A Startup is: “A temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.”

Temporary organization: goal is to be come a large organization

Designed to search: goal is to answer a bunch of questions about a business model

Repeatable: can transact on the business model multiple times

Scalable: you can grow the rate at which you transact on the business model 


Important component of the lean startup: Pivot.

When do you decide to pivot?

Pivot: a substantive change to one or more of the business model components.
- change in customer segment
- change in pricing model
- …

deciding whether to do a pivot:
- this is a function (input = old business model and evidence, output = new business model and yes/no decision)

Executing a pivot:
- also a function (input = existing organization, business model history, new business model; output = new organization, updated business model history)
- Results in changes to engineering, sales or whatever 
- can’t always write a business plan with forecasts based on a series of unknowns
- “fire the plan first” before firing the people


Entrepreneur and startup are two different things.

Lifestyle entrepreneur:
- life is not really about startups
- Passion is elsewhere, just offering your services in an entrepreneurial manner to  acquire the resources necessary to survive 
- Example: someone who only wants to surf offers surfing lessons part time

Small business entrepreneurs:
- majority of entrepreneurs in any country
- Grocery store, dry cleaners, website, database consultant
- Feed the family, extended family, perhaps buy a second house
- They just don’t want to work for someone else, have some level of business

Scalable startup entrepreneur:
- wakes up and says “I’m going to change the world”
- [[Elon Musk]], [[Steve Jobs]], [[Mark Zuckerberg]], … other familiar names
- global view
- Build a team of extraordinary people
- Customer base target of billions of people
- Potential returns are huge, they can attract venture capital

New technology (broadband internet, mobile devices, laptops, cloud services such as [[Amazon Web Services]]) has introduced a new category. Pure Software Startups cost 1/1000 of what they used to cost since 1970. These are viable startups, exit value is about 500M-1G $. Entry costs are highly accessible. Same goes for different industries such as biotech

Corporate entrepreneurs:
- people who know how to innovate in large corporations that were already built to execute
- This can be very difficult because there can be a lot of friction in old organizations depending on company culture

Social entrepreneurs such as NGOs


Investors need to ask: which type of entrepreneur am I investing in? How do I best support them? What are the right tools? What is a good investment strategy?

How do you deal with failure?
- failed entrepreneurs are called “experienced”

Different entrepreneurial clusters around the world. In the clusters people understand:
- failed entrepreneurs don’t shame their family
- Investors and friends will have coffee with them after the failure and ask: what’s your next idea?

Failing in a startup is not the same thing as failing in an existing company with a known business model. With a startup there are a lot of unknowns, there are a lot of guesses to test, it is simply a science experiment to test if the idea is going to work. As long as you test properly, you will either make money, or it won’t work.

Entrepreneurs are like artists. You have to be extremely committed to a strong purpose.

Founders must have “the calling.”

Significance of going global?
“If you’re not born global, you tend to die local.”

Every country needs a regional playbook. Investors and entrepreneurs know general knowledge from Silicon Valley, but local people can start their own blog to talk about what they learned about their own region.

Pieces you need for an entrepreneurial cluster:
- engineering talent
- Entrepreneurs
- Risk capital (investors’ money)
- Government assistance: eliminate bureaucracy and paperwork, entrepreneurial clusters are not job creation programs for local people, you need to attract entrepreneurs from surrounding regions. If you are not attracting entrepreneurs from surrounding regions, you don’t have a cluster.

## How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas | Startup School

(All of this equally applies to finding investment opportunities)

Nobody knows for sure whether an idea will work. Not until tested.

Advice comes from:
- analysis of the top 100 [[Y Combinator]] companies 
- Classic essay by [[Paul Graham]]: “How to Get Startup Ideas”
- From helping [[Y Combinator]] companies with mid-startup pivots 
- Reading 1000s of [[Y Combinator]] applications that they rejected and the mistakes founders make picking ideas

3 parts
- common mistakes with ideas 
- How to tell if idea is good/not
- How to come up with new ideas

Common mistakes:
Mistake 1:
Not solving a real problem.
- problem is something that customers don’t really care about (low priority)
- Solution in search of a problem

Alleviate this mistake with solving a REAL PROBLEM. That is concrete and tractable.

Mistake 2:
Getting stuck on “tar pit ideas”

Ideas that don’t go anywhere.
Causes of tar pit ideas:
- widespread problem that lots of potential founders encounter
- Seems like the problem could be reasonably solved with a startup
- There’s actually a structural reason why the problem is actually very difficult to solve (reason why not solved yet)

Example: 
- trying to make an meetup/event organizing app
- This is much harder than it seems
- Google it, see who’s worked on this before. Talk to them, ask them what the hard parts were

Mistake 3:
Not evaluating the idea.

Mistake 4:
Waiting for the “perfect” idea.

M3 and m4 solution:
- have an idea with some interesting qualities, can have lots of unknowns, but seems tractable 

How to evaluate startup ideas:
Framework has 10 questions.

1 - Do you have founder-market fit?

Example of good founder-market fit:
Plangrid iPad app for dealing with construction plans on job sites.
Co-Founder1 worked in construction and knows the problem, Co-Founder2 is a really good app developer.

This is the most important question to answer. You have to pick a good idea for your team.

2 - How big is the market?

Is market big now? Is market small but rapidly growing?

3 - how acute is the problem?
Do people care about the problem?

Example of good problem:
- Brex, corporate credit cards for startups 
- Before Brex, these did not exist, banks wouldn’t want to give these to startups 

4 - do you have competition?

Competition typically means that existing competitors have some existing market you can tap into ([[Tesla]] with automobiles). No competition is something like coming up with the [[IPhone]].

5 - Do you want this? (Demand)

Do you know people personally that want your thing? Is there demand?

6 - did this only recently become possible? Or did it recently become necessary?

What changed in the marketplace? (Regulations, new technology, new problem)

Checkr for background checks via API. Good for programs such as Uber and DoorDash 

7 - Are there good proxies for this business model?

Proxy is a Large company that does something similar, but not a direct competitor.

Rappi doing DoorDash in Latin America 

8 - is this an idea that you’d be willing to work on for years?

9 - is this a scalable business?

Software is good. Services may be a challenge if you need skilled labour.

10 - is this a good idea space?

Idea space: a class of closely related startup ideas. (Software for hospitals, food delivery services)

Different idea spaces, have different amounts of opportunity. You want a space that you can slowly change your idea into.

Fintech software, compared to online advertising mediums.

Pretty much, if you know there is a problem in this space, then there are opportunities, if there are multiple different possibilities for solutions or variations on the problem then you will have more room to find a good idea.


3 things that make your idea seem bad, but actually make the idea good
- hard to get started
- Boring space (idea space)
- existing competition 

Hard to get started:
Stripe example.
1000s of developers knew this was hard. None of them tried.

You needed special deals with banks, and needed to know lots of nittyngritty details about credit card industry.

Boring idea space:
Payroll software (gusto). Problem sucked, but it was boring so nobody thought to solve it.

Once the initial excitement around the idea of your startup has faded, it pretty much doesn’t matter.

Existing competitors:
Don’t shy away from spaces with competitors.

Sometimes the reason there are no competitors, such as nobody wants the product.

You can analyze all the competitors, and see something they all miss, or realize that they all “suck.”

Dropbox was like the 20th online file storage company.
- they had realized that most of the existing solutions had shitty UI
- Technical insight was to integrate the file storage directly into the operating system’s file system so you can sync files automatically 

How to come up with startup ideas:

Sitting down and thinking about startup ideas is possible to generate good ideas, but perhaps not the best way.

Best way: notice the ideas organically.

How to put yourself in positions to have organic ideas:
- become an expert on something valuable 
- Work at a startup
- Build things that you find interesting (good for programmers)

7 recipes for sitting down and ideating:
- 1 start with what your team is especially good at, that way you automatically have founder-market fit
	- Rezi idea
	- Real estate people and debt financed experience

- 2 start with a problem you’ve personally encountered, ideally you’re in a unique position to see the problem
	- Vetco
	- Ordering supplies for vets

How to use steps 1 and 2:
- for each founder, think about every job you’ve had (including internships and life experiences)
- For each experience, what problems or opportunities were you in a special position to see?

- 3 think of things you personally wished existed
	- DoorDash example
	- Super simple
	- However this recipe is prone to tar pit ideas so be diligent


- 4 look for things in the word that have changed recently
	- Covid had a bunch of changes
	- Gathertown is a way ti hangout with friends online

- 5 look at successful companies, and figure out some variants
	- nuvo cargo
	- helps companies export from [[United States|USA]] to [[Mexico]]
	- picked for analytical reasons 
	- Large market, good proxies, didn’t have deep domain expertise but had good connections 

- 6 go and talk to people and ask people what problems they have.
	- This can work but it requires a lot of skill
	- Pick a fertile idea space, talk to people in that space
	- Talk to both potential customers and founders of companies in the idea space
	- AtoB example
		- Founders were young and had not much experience 
		- They make fuel cards (special credit cards for trucking industry)
	- Systematic process:
		- Pick fertile idea space (software for trucking)
		- then founder into experts (they drove to truck stops and start talking to truckers about what kinds of problems they have)
		- ask founders about industry (talked to founders in trucking industry, found out about the industry, what are the opportunities, what has already been tested)
		- Evaluate several ideas (AtoB team evaluated multiple ideas before settling on fuel cards)
	- This was a really good approach, this is a really good way to find a startup idea

- 7 look for big industry that seems broken

Bonus idea: find a co-founder that already has an idea. Check out Y Combinator’s online platform for matching. Good way to get a co-founder. 

Always remember that you have to test the idea to actually know if it’s good.

## Steve Blank: How to Build a Great Company, Step by Step | 8.14.1
Source5: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1RTcXwJuCaU

Startups are not smaller versions of large companies.

A plan/startup is just a series of untested guesses.

Startups begin on faith, turn that faith into facts as quickly as you can.

 Don’t use a [[Business Plan]], use a [[Business Model]]: any company (business unit) is described in a series of 9 components ([[Business Model Canvas]] by Alexander Osterwalder)
 - value proposition = what you build = product
 - customer segments = Who do you make product for 
 - Channels = how to get the product from you to the customers 
 - Customer relationships = acquire, keep, grow customers (sales & marketing)
 - Revenue model = how to make money
 - Partners
 - Resources
 - Activities
 - Costs

This [[Business Model Canvas]] works for all new ventures. Not just for tech.

Apocryphal story of [[Nokia]] on day 1 of the [[IPhone]]. Fatal question: What is their market share?

Disruption on day 1, to a large corporation, looks like a toy. You need a continuous process to deal with innovation.

Turning [[Business Model]] hypotheses into facts is called [[Customer Development]].

You haven’t validated your hypotheses until you see your customers pupils dilate.

Culture and people in a startup start with the founder.

As a founder, you’re a visionary, but you must always ask yourself the question, “what if I’m wrong?”

Story about the founder firing the VP of sales.

Founder should not hire a VP of sales, the founder should get out of the building and talk to customers with a customer development team.

Job specifications between startups and large corporations are completely different (for the same title). Corporations -> execute, startup -> go through a series of guesses without a roadmap.

Instead of firing executives, fire the plan. Pivot on the components of the plan.

For a startup to become a company, it must go through 3 phases:
- validation of business model (operate in chaos)
- begin executing on the business model (build out required infrastructure to start executing)
- Growing at scale ([[Scaling Past 8 Figures with Organizational Excellence|Super scaling]])

“A failed entrepreneur is experienced.”
- if you honestly fail and learn from it

Entrepreneurs need to run pattern recognition on all the customers they meet. 

This guy went below the [[Business Model Canvas]] and went below to intention network. There were multiple sides to the market. Some markets have multiple different sides, medical equipment: doctor, patient, hospital, insurance company, regulator. This happens when old things are done in new ways. 

Don’t worry too much about age when considering entrepreneurship.

Before committing to a team, test your idea with third parties. Build the smallest possible piece of a product so that you can test and learn something.

Once you have a [[Business Model]], you will probably have a particular [[Sales Model]] that may be complex. Once you find a repeatable sales pattern, you may want to hire a VP of sales. You will want to still be able to change the sales model going forward, so the VP of sales must be very flexible. [[Steve Blank]] had a story where his VP of sales memorized the sales presentation, and therefore had a disincentive to change it.

Biggest mistake tech founders make: I don’t know sales, so I’m going to I’m going to hire a VP of sales, he had a great Rolodex and came with great references. You’re out of business, because you will get Bullshitted out of business your whole life. Make sure you know the basics of sales.

Wondering what can you learn from unpaid user testing. You can’t validate the assumptions around the problem you are solving (by giving your product for free) while at the same time validating if they are willing to pay for it. Sometimes you can use a Free-mium model for B2B but not always.

There is always a job in a company which your new product threatens. The person/people with this job are the Saboteurs.

Large companies have to figure out how to integrate new products and not be trapped by success. Challenge with big companies is that the visionaries leave and go try new stuff and then executing professionals come in to run the business. The execution pros are not usually that good at changing the business and being dynamic.

Microsoft is a partner-built and driven organization. They have a series of programs that connects with and partners with service building tech entrepreneurs. First is with students dreamspark program. Imagine cup contest. BizSpark program, they let small business (less than 5 years old) use Microsoft services for free for 3 years. There are Microsoft innovation centers around the world. 

Customers say they “like the product,” but they’re not buying, what do we do? “Only the buyers will tell you the truth.” You need to find what pain you solve and what gain your provide for customers. People tend to buy to solve their top 3-5 problems. If someone tells you they like the product, ask them, “where does this rank in the pain you have or gains you want?” If they say in top 3, then you have to be way blunter by asking “now give me your wallet.” Then if they say no, good, now you can have a conversation asking “why not?”

Business is 10% of what you’re presented with and 90% what you do with what you’re presented with. And what you’re presented with is in “the book” ([[Steve Blank]]’s book).

Book “[[The Four Steps to the Epiphany]]” by [[Steve Blank]].

Great entrepreneurs
- relentless 
- Irrational 
- Passionate
- See things other people dont
- they All think they’re visionaries, but data says 98%
- Sometimes grew up in disfunctional families (better to deal with chaos)

Sometimes being comfortable in chaos makes you uncomfortable when working to grow and scale once you have found the repeatable [[Business Model]].

To make great artists, you can let people self select to become apprentices of existing great artists.

They changed this so that they taught art appreciation throughout young ages at school.

To create the biggest pool of entrepreneurs, teach them entrepreneurial appreciation throughout being young. Make that a vocational pathway just like art, sports, and academics.

Lean Startup is aka Evidence-Based Entrepreneurship.

[[Business Model Canvas]] is what you want when you generate revenue.

[[Mission Model Canvas]] is what you want when you don’t generate revenue (example for Department of Defence, regulatory body, risk management function)

Horizon 1 initiative = improve execution of known [[Business Model]]

Horizon 2 initiative = expanding on the current [[Business Model]]

Horizon 3 Initiative (startup) = search for a new [[Business Model]]


When you want to “spin in” and scale up an Horizon 3 initiative, you have to do a refactor step.

When you do the Horizon 3, you’re going to do a bunch of engineering shortcuts that leave you with spaghetti code and a big mess. If you want to integrate that into an existing business or scale it up, you need it to be consistent in quality so that you can consistently improve upon it.

The need to refactor is known as [[Technical Debt]]. If you don’t get rid of the [[Technical Debt]], then it will grow in interest and compound until the original people who built the tech are nowhere to be found to understand the tech and you are left with an unsolvable problem that people don’t know how to deal with because they can’t modify the tech.

So a company needs a process organization responsible for refactoring.

You want a continuous cycle of improvement from horizon 3 to 2 to 1.

You want to get the horizon 1 finance and legal people and support groups to go and help and enable the horizon 3 initiatives , but NOT SLOW THEM DOWN. This lets them work well with less of a need to worry about the legal and finance issues.

Horizon 3 people get to write their own rules. Horizon 1 people have a 7 day process to veto those rules.

## The Biggest Startup Opportunities In 2024 | [[Eric Ries]] (The Lean Startup)
Source: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=l2AnqA-jY10

[[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] wrapper startups are kinda like this analogy [[Eric Ries]] said called “picking up dimes in front of a steam roller”

Big [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] companies are the steam rollers, using their apis in a simple but new way is like picking up the dimes.

Picking up the dimes can be worth it here if you can get customer information that you can take advantage of to build a “steamroller” of your own. It can also be worth it if you don’t have that much experience and you want to do a cool thing and at the same time improve your software development skills.


To talk to customers, just ask whoever you can, if they don’t know that much, ask them who they think would know more, then talk to those people who might know more.

There was a company that set up their developers in a retail store ([[Nordstrom]]) and they asked customers questions about their iPad/mobile apps and were able to test super quickly.

[[Google]] and % certainty of submitting quarterly reports vs. sun rising tomorrow vs. google employee killing somebody for benefit of company (without reporting an accident).

Trust is the most important asset.

Customers seeing you stand up for them when you didn’t have to.

Websites should have a “what do I stand for tab” and direct empirical examples to go along with it.

Loyalty comes as a side effect of doing the right thing over and over and over again. 

If you want to have a foundation/nonprofit as part of your company and you want to fund them with 1% of your revenue, then make sure all the contracts when people pay you have 99% go to you and 1% go direct to your nonprofit.

## Designing the Ideal Bootstrapped Business with Jason Cohen
Source: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=otbnC2zE2rw

When he says “bootstrapped” he means “self-funded.”

Mindframe:
- a predictable way to make cash after quitting your job
- Set up some kind of bare-minimum passive income so you can quit “your job” (example 10K in each founder pocket)

Revenue models
- One-time purchases for software are evergreen products
- Recurring purchases are better

Number of customers 150
- 50 super fans
- 25 guest posts / social
- 75 basic marketing

Texhnique
- find consultants on LinkedIn 
- Email them about [[WordPress]] hosting designed for folks like you. I would love to talk to you about your pain or needs (customer development). Now I know your time is valuable (you’re a consultant), I absolutely don’t want you to feel like I’m just trying to grab time from you. I am very happy to pay, whatever you think is fair, for an hour of your time, even if that’s more than your normal hourly rate because I appreciate that this is a one off thing.
- this was asked to 40 leads found on LinkedIn , all 40 replied positively, 38 followed through with the interview (2 did not schedule a time) (none of them asked for money)


Getting people to pay annually instead of monthly is better so that you have more money now.

How to get more annuals:
- 3 months free if you pay annual at some other place
- X months free
- Use the monthly price to compare against annual

How to charge more
- set the business plan as the more expensive one so that businesses sign up for that one
- Instead of 15 day free trial, give them a 60 day money back guarantee 


Some markets are harder to get money from
- consumers are typically super cheap and don’t want to spend much money
- B2B is the best
- Bad markets
	- Market in which the pain the customer experiences is temporary, where we have to catch them in a certain point in their life (weddings, special events, free trial solves the problem)
	- viralityness (requires going viral)
		- Hard to get going before having a large audience to start with
	- Market places (bringing buyers and sellers together)
		- Ebay 
		- Etsy
		- Amazon (kind of)
		- Bad since you have two businesses (convince sellers to sell, convince buyers to buy)
		- Good though once you are successful, your business is defensible
- good markets
	- Value is naturally recurring, therefore recurring costs
		- Financial cycles (month/quarter/annual, invoice software)
		- On-going actual costs
		- the Pain you are solving for changes over time naturally (digital marketing)
		- support (may be expensive due to human time, priority response to issues)
	- **not real time**, it is not important that the customer gets something from you in this instant, or else they leave.  Counter example: web hosting
		- Decision support (analytics, metrics, reports, monitoring) (data may be real-time, but the availability or access to data does not need to be, therefore stock market data for day traders is a bad example)
		- Finance 
		- [[Project Management]] (e.g. trello)
		- Content 
	- something that can be “finished” (this gets you out of a feature war with another product where your success is tied to competing with others on features)
		- WinZIP
		- Freshbooks
		- Basecamp
		- Hosting
		- Time-tracking
		- Bug tracking
		- CRM
		- Wiki
		- Task management 
		- Email
		- PDF editor 
		- Image editor 
		- Web analytics
	- After markets (there is always an established market that has a large following, and you can tack onto the end of it)
		- Smart bear, balsamiq (markup designer), woothemes (Wordpress themes), alien skin (photoshop plugins), QODBC (sell a product that takes a quick books file and allows you to do database queries on it)
		- SalesForce, Heroku, Apple App Store, 
	- Big Market (lots of people spending lots of money)
		- Lots of Niches
		- Room for “me-too” (doesn’t have to be the No. 1 best product)
		- Validated Space (there is a pain to solve)
		- Easy to locate customers
		- you can expand if you want down the line


Customer acquisition models
- adverts are better than social media (I don’t think this is the case now a days ) (he wants a dollar in, 2 dollar out) (look into Luke belmar’s funnel)
- Cost per click thing: http://blog.asmartbear.com
