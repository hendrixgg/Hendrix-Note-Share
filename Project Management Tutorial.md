## What is a Project
A temporary endeavor undertaken to produce a unique product, service, or result.
## What is Project Management
The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.
## What is a Stakeholder
- an individual, group, or organization
- may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by project:
    - decisions,
    - activity, or
    - outcomes
## Stakeholder Management Plan
> A [[Project Manager]] is responsible for collecting all requirements from all project stakeholders.

Use a [[Stakeholder Register Template]] to keep track of all stakeholders.

Stakeholder identification -(inputs to)> Stakeholder register
Stakeholder register -(inputs to)> Develop Stakeholder Engagement Strategy
Stakeholder Analysis -(inputs to)> Develop Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

Continuously build working relationships with internal stakeholders.
## Pre-Sales Phase
This phase of the project occurs if the [[legal entity]] executing/managing the project is external to the business sponsor [[legal entity]] for the project.

During this phase, there are negotiations taking place to determine the scope, budget, and feasibility of the project.

Outcome of this phase is a signed contract from the business sponsor to enable initiation of the project.

## [[Risk Management]] Process 
This starts upon first contact with the business sponsor of the project.

![[Pasted image 20240604145656.png]]
apply the Risk Identification techniques:
- always ask "do you see any risks here?"
log risks in the risk register
select critical risks and develop risk response plans - talk about later when discussing planning

this process never stops

To implement Risk Responses, you need a need to develop Risk Response Plans.

## Project Initiation
things to identify:
1. Business Objective
2. Unique results
3. Boundaries of the scope

we put together a [[Project Charter]].

Once you get signed approval of the project charter, you have to 
- start more communications with your environment
- decide on project management approach
    - probably only about 3 different approaches in your organization
- 

## Project Management Plan
Main components:
- Integration
    - plan the project so that deliverables are achieved as defined in the [[Project Charter]]
    - identify, define, combine, unify, coordinate other processes
    - first step: identify: dig deeper into the high-level information in the [[Project Charter]] 
- Scope
    - ensure all required work included
    - ensure no extra/unnecessary work is done
    - templates: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aynnTuZq4qaTgZoZxMDFPFLIL-nZuFZ_cuQIKae7lNc/edit#heading=h.6p1bnx9onfvj
    - this is where you will create a [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
    - Take project charter -(extract)> High-level requirements -(***specify***)> specific requirements
        - use the [[Stakeholder Register Template]] to ***specify***
    - There is a [[Hierarchy of Requirements]]
    - to capture and organize requirements, use a [[Requirements Traceability Matrix]]
    - [[Business Analyst]] and [[Business System Analyst]] are helpful roles for defining project requirements
    - Once you have high-level scope identified you can do
    - need to convert abstract list of requirements into tangible results -> deliverables
        - there is no standard way to do this
        - depends on industry
        - [[Requirements Traceability Matrix]] + [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] helps a lot here
    - deliverables can be a set of related requirements
    - [[Project Scope Statement]] can be created once you have clarified the deliverables
        - clients should be confident in the statement
        - clients should sign the scope statement (usually in the [[Project Charter]]) for approval
    - Then you create the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] from [[Project Scope Statement]]
        - the [[Work Breakdown Structure]] along with [[Work Implementation Plan]] is captured in [[#Project Management Software]]
        - this will depend on the Resources you have to execute the project
            - people
            - materials
            - equipment
            - tools
        - sometimes you will need to procure new stuff -> Procurement
        - once you have stuff -> you have resources
- Quality
    - This process begins once you have some requirements logged in your [[Requirements Traceability Matrix]]
    - this process ensures that the requirements are satisfied
- Schedule
    - [[Rolling Wave Planning]]
    - plan the next few weeks of work, all the way down to the task level
    - keep farther out pieces of work planned at a high level
    - determine timing of deliverables
        - depends on Resource
        - depends on the people available
        - project manager should not estimate tasks by themselves
            - ask project team to do it, or
            - ask for an expert to estimate (if project team not available) - note the knowledge level of the expert when doing estimates
        - draft the schedule
    - [[How to Create a Realistic Project Schedule]]
- Cost
    - determined based on the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] and Schedule
    - use [[Chapter 2 - Cost-Estimation Techniques]]
    - bottom-up estimate is best
        - when you already have a lot of resources in house, 
            - calculating costs may not be necessary
            - perhaps you just want to track hours to see that people are doing work
            - perhaps just track what resources are being used
    - draft the project budget
    - 
- Resource
    - HR Acquisition Plan
    - 
- Communications
- Risk
    - Identify risks using a [[Risk Register]]
    - risks related to 
        - List of Activities
            - Duration
            - Cost
            - Dependencies
            - Assign Resources
        - Resources Management Plan
        - Draft Project Schedule
        - Draft Project Budget
        - Project Charter
        - Project Management Plan
        - Quality Management Plan
        - Procurement Documentation
        - scope
            - [[Project Scope Statement]]
            - [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
            - [[Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary]]
        - Any other Important Info
    - use the [[#Risk Management Process]]
- Procurement
    - HR Acquisition Plan
    - Procurement Management Plan
- Stakeholder

## Project Management Software
you need tool(s) to
- store, organize, update 100's of tasks
- tasks have lots of attributes
- assign dependencies and line up the timing using a [[Gantt Chart]]
- tracking attributes manually is time consuming and painful

## Project Baselines (Plan)
used to track progress to the initial goal.
- Scope Baselines
    - [[Project Scope Statement]]
    - [[Work Breakdown Structure]]
    - [[Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary|WBS Dictionary]]
- Schedule Baselines
    - Approved [[How to Create a Realistic Project Schedule]]
- Cost Baselines
    - Approved Time-phased Project Schedule

This is pretty much the same as the [[Project Management Plan]].

When you see deviations from the plan, you apply:
- productivity techniques
- motivation (of project team)
- leadership tricks
- perhaps some micro-management

When you have determined that the project will have to deviate from the Baselines (in the [[Project Management Plan]]) then you will have to submit a [[#Project Change Request]]

## Project Change Request
- submitted when you want to change the [[#Project Baselines (Plan)]].

## Project Execution
You as the project manager still has to do stuff during project execution.

Why things still have to be done:
- plan only "outlines" the work
- does not contain all the detailed instructions for the technical problems
- you will have to solve conflicts
- does not motivate cross team interactions

What you have to do (Communication):
- Encourage, Facilitate
    - Interactions between
        - Stakeholders ([[#Stakeholder Management Plan]])
        - Team Members
        - Subject matter experts
    - daily/weekly/monthly
- motivate
    - problem solving
    - implement solutions
- Resolve conflicts
- track progress
- remove impediments/blockers
- conduct interviews
- performance reviews 
- one-on-ones
- trainings
- discussions

> A project manager communicates about 80% of the time.

### Overview on Project Life Cycle
![[Pasted image 20240605084841.png]]
- Planning is intensive but relatively short compared to execution
- execution is a "daily grind"

### Project Routines
1. Project Information/Documentation Maintenance - DAILY updates
    1. spend about 30 minutes
    2. team members are reporting:
        1. progress
        2. time spent
        3. expenses
        4. risks
        5. other performance data, see [[Project Management Productivity#Habits]] (habit #4)
    3. done inside the [[#Project Management Software]]
    4. better to do daily because information is fresher in your mind
2. Status Report
    1. Sync up (status report) with Project Team - Daily/Weekly/Bi-Weekly depending on the pace of the project
        1. progress, problems
    2. Sync up (status report) with Project Owners (Business Sponsors) - Daily/Weekly/Bi-Weekly depending on the pace of the project
        1. updated on an
3. motivation meeting
    1. 2-3 team members per day
    2. as needed, depends on project/industry
4. communications 
    1. 2-4 timeslots per day
    2. plan to address emails

bonuses
- book meetings to be consecutive
    - this allows you to chunk out time for deep work

## How to make things work together
what he says: buy his course.

I'm just going to consolidate all this info and notes into my own cohesive framework.

The framework will be mapped out visually with obsidian canvas, showing chronological view. There will also have to be other process views to show step-by-steps. the idea will be: All the arrows in a particular canvas will carry the same meaning.

also, figure out how to incorporate this comment from the youtube video:


Great video.  Just a note or two on daily PM tasks:  I don't find it necessary to meet everyday with the team and owners.  Most owners are extremely busy with other day-to-day tasks that generate revenue for the business.  I always send out bi-weekly status reports (Powerpoint format usually with updates on costs, resources, schedules, action items, etc.).  And, I always put high visibility notes in the email body (like off schedule, overrun costs, etc).  If the project is shorter in duration or if the stakeholders want/need the information more readily available, I will issue status reports in a weekly manner.  The most important thing I do everyday is ensure that my emails are allocated correctly.  Your brain is made for execution, not storing information.  Every email is tagged into a project folder or tagged as follow-up.  If I need to follow-up, I add it to my daily notebook under each project.  If I need to speak to someone, I add it to my daily notebook under each project.  I always send out minutes from every meeting.  At the end of the day, I go through my daily notebook (Microsoft OneNote is perfect for this) and proceed to mark items off the list as I complete them.  This allows me to manage multiple projects at one time.  We don't use [[#Project Managment Software|PM software]] at all.
