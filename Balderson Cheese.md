The cheese is award winning in taste/eating quality. Nowhere on their website do they mention anything about their ingredients being sourced of a high-quality. They just mention that their ingredients are "simple" which is true.

Their cheese is not organic, which means that their milk cows could be:
- injected with antibiotics
- eat [[Estrogen in Grain|mouldy grains]] instead of grass
- eat food that is sprayed with pesticides

Their parent company [Lactalis](https://www.lactalis.ca/our-brands/consumer-brands/) is a large multinational corporation that also does not have any clear incentive to produce food without the use of pesticides.
