## Preparation
[Why You Should Always Soak and Cool Your Rice Before Eating](https://m.youtube.com/shorts/2dn4uc_bxwk)
- soak rice in water overnight, then discard water, because rice likely has arsenic on it and it gets dissolved in the water
- cool the rice
- Put rice in refrigerator, wait until next day
	- Do this because it makes the rice into a resistant starch, which means it no longer has the same insulin effect upon digestion as I would have had if eaten freshly cooked
- reheat rice when you want to eat it
