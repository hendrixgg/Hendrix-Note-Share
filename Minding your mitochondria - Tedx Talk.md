ted talk from 2011-11-30

## Intro
- speaker diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS)
    - took all kinds of medication
    - use a wheelchair
    - then turned to latest related medical research: huntington's, parkinsons, ...
    - today she is walking and healthy
- those related diseases had in common: bad mitochondria function in brain
    - research showed reversing effects on mice taking: fish oil, creatine, co-enzyme Q10
    - those supplements slowed her decline, but not cured
- learned more brain cell biology
    - myelin insulates brain wiring
    - MS damages myelin
    - vitamins to improve myelin:
        - B1 - thiamine
        - B9 - folate
        - B12 - cobalamin
        - Omega 3 fatty acids
        - Iodine
    - neurotransmitters between neurons, require: sulur, vitamin B6
- mitochondria give you energy
    - lots of chemical reactions for mitochondiral functions
    - which compounds did you need to consume and how much 
        - b vitamins
        - sulfur
        - antioxidants
    - it occurred to take these nutrients from foods instead of supplements
    - there was little literature/information from medical sources or dieticians on contents of those nutrients in food
        - internet research had the answers
- now figure out what diet has all these nutrients
- first look at what americains eat commonly
    - most people don't eat 1 "full" dinner plates of vegetables per day, let alone 2 or 3 as the speaker consumes
    - showing what an american family eats
    - % americans below recommended daily allowance of vital nutrients
        - these nutrients form the building blocks to vital chemical reactions from mitochondria
        - lacking these building blocks results in
            - chronic disease
            - children born with jaws that are too small - leading to crooked teeth and small brains
            - why blood vessels become stiff as you age
            - 1/3 american children, 1/2 africanamerican/hispanic get diabetes as children
- looking and 2.5 million years ago
    - paleo diet
    - hunter gathers
    - organic
    - hunter gatherers exceed nutrient RDAs by 2 to 10 fold
    - these diets have more nutrition than all modern "recommended diets"
- then look at what diet speaker developed

## Daily Diet
- 3 cups of green leaves
    - dinner plate "heaped high"
    - rich in: 
        - b vitamins: protect brain cells and mitochondria
        - vitamins a, c: support immune cells
        - vitamin k: blood vessels and bone health
        - minerals: cofactors for hundred of enzymes in our bodies (cofactors enable the functions of enzymes which do the important reactions in our cells for all body function)
    - what to eat
        - two types of kale: most nutrition per calorie of any plant
        - parsley
        - "cooked greens"
        - dehydrated kale chips are good also
    - greens reduce risk of cataracts and macular degeneration
- 3 cups of sulfur rich vegetables
    - sulfur required for
        - brain
        - mitochondria
        - liver + kidneys for toxin removal from blood
    - what to eat
        - "cabbage family" 
            - cabbage
            - broccoli
            - cauliflower
            - brussels sprouts
            - turnips
            - rutabagas
            - radishes
            - collards
            - kale
        - onion family
            - onions
            - garlic
            - leeks
            - chives
            - shallots
        - mushrooms
        - asparagus
- 3 cups of "bright color"
    - take 3 different cups of "colors" ever day
    - colors are fruits/vegetables high in: flavonoids, polyphenols (antioxidants)
        - required for: retinas, mitocondria, toxin removal 
    - what to eat:
        - vegetables:
            - carrots
            - beets
            - peppers
            - red cabbage
        - berries + bright colored fruits
            - peaches
            - oranges
            - strawberries
            - blueberries
            - razzberries
            - blackberries
- *added in*: high-quality protein
    - wild fish = omega 3 fatty acids = Myelin and straight teeth + good jaw + larger brain
        - salmon
        - herring
- grass fed meat
- organ meat
    - concentrated sources in: vitamins, minerals, coenzyme Q
        - support mitochondria
    - mentioned
        - liver
        - heart
        - tongue
        - gizzarsd
        - sweetbreaks
    - consume once per week
- seaweed
    - source of: 
        - iodine:
            - brain uses for myelin
            - remove toxins: mercury, lead, other heavy metals
            - lowers risk of breast + prostate cancer
        - selenium - didn't mention why this is good
    - have once per week

## Closing
- most Americans can't imagine having 9 cups of vegetables + berries + fruits each day
    - eat all those before eating any grains or potatoes
    - food allergies come from 
        - grains: because of gluten, and
        - dairy: because of casein protein
    - these allergies are related to (including but not limited to):
        - eczema
        - asthma
        - allergies
        - infertility
        - irritable bowel
        - fibromyalgia
        - chronic fatigue
        - arthritis
        - chronic headache
        - neurological problems
        - behaviour problems
- eating this diet is expensive
    - you will pay the price now for healthy food that will restore your health and vitality
    - or pay the price in doctor visits, prescription drugs, surgeries, missed time from work, early retirement, nursing home care
- referring back to how bad speaker was before designing this diet
    - 3 months: reduce from 2 canes to 1
    - 4 months: walk throughout hospital no cane
    - 5 months: rode bike for the first time in a decade around block
    - 9 months: rode bike 18 miles
    - 1 year: trail ride on horses in canadian rockies
- speaker will continue to research this diet and her findings through clinical trials
    - results will be posted to 2011 Neuroscience convention
    - her scientific articles: https://terrywahls.com/news/articles/
    - how to support her work: https://www.thewahlsfoundation.com/the-wahls-foundation-and-how-you-may-support-us/
    - 
- challenge people to become "modern day hunter gatherers"
    - eat for your mitochondria
- what will your choice be?
