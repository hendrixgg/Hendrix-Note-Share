Studied 10 most powerful empires.

Last 3 reserve currencies.

Focusing on (Dutch) British, USA, and China

Changes in leading empires happens in overlapping cycles.

Empire power is measured by averaging metrics: the 8 strength
- educations
- Technology
- Economic competitiveness 
- Economic output
- word trade
- Military strength
- Financial Strength for capital markets 
- Strength for currency as reserve currency

education improvements spark an increase in the other strengths , but they are lagging

Simple process:
- major conflict establishing new leading power
- Prosperity period where people donâ€™t feel like challenging the order
- good stuff happening with prosperity makes people want to bet money on the new empire
- Borrowing money for investing in new empire creates bubble
- More transactions make empire currency reserve currency
- Increased prosperity distributes wealth unevenly, (this makes sense due to compounding of winners continuing to win and losers losing)
- Financial bubble bursting makes printing money
- Printing money causes internal conflict between rich and poor
- Internal conflict causes wealth redistribution event (civil war or peaceful)
- internal conflict diminishes empire strength, other empires on the rise
- When new rising power can compete with dominant power, we get wars
- Wars create new winners/losers and in turn, a new world order

Times ahead will be different to how they happened in our lifetimes, but they are patterns that have happened before.

Painful surprises can be shown to be repetitions of past circumstances.

Story about how he realized this:

- 1971
- Us ran out of money, defaulting on debts 
- They printed too much money and everyone wanted to exchange it for gold
- President said people could no longer exchange dollars for gold
- Making currency in US dependent on economy
- This caused devaluation of currency

This same story happened in 1933.

Same thing happened so many times before.

Governments spending more than they got in taxes. 

**Principle1:** When central banks print a lot of money, buy stocks, gold, and commodities.

**Principle2:** to understand what is coming at you, you need to understand what came before you.

### things that were new
1. Countries not having enough money to pay debts even with 0% interest rates. Lots of money printing
2. Big internal conflicts with politics
3. External conflict with [[China]] rising and [[USA]] falling in power.

### what is an order?
Governing system for people dealing with each other.

Laws are internal orders. Perhaps even even civil wars.

Treaties are for international order.

Current world order is set by [[WW2]] where [[USA]] got USD as world reserve currency.
