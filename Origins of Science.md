Christianity and its links to science.

Pioneers who where founders of ccience were Christian.

People deny the obvious by hiding the truth.

## Words and Works of God
Book of Words of God is the Bible. We study the Bible to better understand God’s word.

Book of Works of God is the natural universe. We study the natural universe to better understand the works of God.

## Foundational Principles (must be revised/clarified)
1. ***==Intelligibility==*** - The universe can be understood by a rational/reasonable agent. Why: because God created the universe and God is reasonable.
2. ***==Capability==*** - Us humans are capable of understanding the universe. Why: because humans were created in the image of God, as capable of reason. 
3. ***==Desirability==*** - It is good for us to understand the universe. Why: to worship God by better understanding his Works.

Implications:
- intelligibility: everything in the universe follows a set of laws
- capability: those laws are mathematical, a kind of speech
- these things are not surprising at all in the frame of Christian theism. More surprising from the framework of naturalism.  I’m not entirely convinced of this.

Every time you prove/disprove a scientific hypothesis using observations from empirical experiments, you are confirming the 3 foundational principles above.

> Is that really true? How do we know when we used “reason” (proving the intelligible/capable parts). Still need to clarify the framework.


why trust your reasoning:
- Darwin doubted it, considering he wouldn’t trust a monkey
- I would say, trusting it works (predictions of how things act based on laws can be true) and it gives you more confidence/power. Perhaps you get that power/confidence from God?

Why we say science is good:
- taken for granted
- speaker implies that understanding the universe does not help you multiply or reproduce 
	- I would argue that it does because you can make more informed decisions that increase longevity or other aspects of security
	- If you know more, you can travel outside solars system and become resistant to earth catastrophes.
	- This is unclear
- I say this comes from the desire to create. To be able to create, we must know how things work so that the creation can work

## foundational hypothesis
If we are right about what the universe is and about what we are and about the value of knowledge, then we will be able to figure [insert scientific hypothesis] out.

Every time you confirm/disconfirm scientific hypothesis then you are confirming the foundational hypothesis.

## dis confirmation of naturalism
If the 3 foundational principles contradict naturalism, and those principles are verified by proving/disproving a scientific hypothesis, then every scientific hypothesis ever tested is evidence required for disconfirmation of naturalism. This would imply that no other scientific hypothesis has more disconfirmation than naturalism.

I think the first clause of the conditional (the 3 principles contradict naturalism) is false. Based on my current understanding of naturalism, naturalism does not give any hint as to whether those statements would be true/false on face value. More clarification needed.
