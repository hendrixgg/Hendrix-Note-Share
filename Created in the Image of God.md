This was a video about [[Mark Zuckerberg]].

The speaker talks about genesis in the Bible. It starts with “God created, God creates, creates, creates…” and then God created man, male and female in his image. This means that man is to create. And man is to have a relationship with God, other people, and the world/environment.

important thing: ***==CREATE==***

This video is about [[Norm McDonald]].

Norm had an intuition that a personal God exists. That God is a person, not a force. 

People have a **function** and a **structure**.

## Function
Image god.

Be a mirror that takes in the world and other people, and reflects god.

## structure
This is the physical body we have. The brain we have that is capable of creating and innovating.

The structure can be used to serve the ideal function, or to pervert it. Similar to how any new capability/technology can be used for either good or bad. 

## more
People always image god, but often in defective ways.
