Summary:
- Longevity 
	- improving longevity is to slow down your biological clock
	- Biological clock is the rate at which your telomeres shrink 
	- Telomeres are at the ends of your DNA. Analogy: caps at the end of your shoelaces.
	- Telomeres shorten each time your cells divide
	- Cells divide when you are performing various functions in the body. Digestion is a significant function
	- methods to limit cell division from digestion 
		- Eating fewer calories 
		- Fasting (different types)
			- Intermittent 
			- 1-3 day water fast
			- Longer fasts with/without water
		- Cells being able to maintain a more consistent state
			- Maintain consistent glucose levels by eating mostly foods low in glycemic index
	- Cells can only divide a finite number of times until they become senescent, which means they no longer perform their function. 
	- senescent cells have to be processed as waste in the body and then replaced with new healthy cells
	- new healthy cells cannot replace the senescent cell until after the senescent cell has been removed
	- Your body recognizes senescent cells by the immune system
	- The immune system processes the senescent cells as waste to make way for new healthy cells
- Immune system
	- Your immune system works to regulate damage/disease/waste in the body
	- Your immune system is controlled by hormones which then cause various regular/specialized cells to perform actions
	- your immune system can become weakened and exhausted, this is common among cancer patients 
	- you can identify the state of your immune system through testing 
	- hormones that control immune system are produced by another type of system in the body (endocrine)
	- Endocrine system is affected by the food we eat, are we breathe, water we drink
	- You can do diagnostic testing to see how these systems are functioning and if you should do something about it
- Stem cells and Exasomes
	- These can be used to kickstart various exhausted or weakened processes in the body
	- Stem cells are the undifferentiated cells, fat, brain, bone, blood, immune, …
	- exasomes are produced by all cells and are used for communication 
	- If processes in the body are not operating properly, stem cells can be provided to produce exasomes to get those processes back on track
	- immune system cells that aren’t taking care of senescence can be helped out by stronger more capable immune cells (trained in lab)
	- More research being done on this still
	- To access these therapies you have to go outside of [[United States|USA]] and [[Canada]] because regulatory is slow and these therapies are new


- Rafael:
	- PhD in anatomy and Neurobiology 
	- Last 20 years in regenerative medicine 
	- Slowing down the biological clock
- Brian
	- Manufacturing of exosomes (similar to stem cells)
- slowing down cells from dividing is the key to longevity 
- Cells have to divide to digest food
- Cells can split only a finite amount of time. After which, cells become senescent (zombie cells).
- Average practical steps
	- Fasting
		- When you fast, you **slow down cell division**
		- Cells don’t divide when fasting 
		- They go into preservation mode
		- Increases insulin growth factor IGF
	- maintain the key of everything that is in our body
		- Glucose enters every cell in the body
		- Maintaining glucose levels consistent is the key to success
		- Maintaining glucose at consistent level you limit cell division again
	- Caloric restriction is another key
- What happens in the body when you do a 3 day water fast
	- Analogy: body eats itself from the weakest/waste part upward
	- During fasting, body eats waste in cells as energy
	- Cancer feeds on sugar
	- Fasting halts cancer
- A lot of issues arise from chronic inflammation 
- 3 Risk markers for disease: If these are elevated you have increased risk for aging related cardiovascular/neurodegenerative disease
	- HS CRP
	- TNF Alpha - one of the strongest controllers in the immune system of the pro-inflammatory 
	- Interluken 6
- What to do when those markers are elevated? Answer the following questions 
	- What are you missing in diet? 
	- What should you supplement?
- If your immune system lacks the inflammatory markers, that is a sign of weakness
	- Cancer patients have weakened/exhausted immune systems, which is why they have cancer cells they cannot get rid of
	- elevated interluken 10, which is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that blocks immune responses 
- every major religion in the world has a fasting component 
	- Fasting makes people sharper and closer to God
- Standard fast Gary breaks does is 3 day water fast
- Other fasts
	- At a certain point you will start losing muscle
	- Fasting on a regular basis
	- Fasting mimicking diets (very low calorie)
	- Intermittent fasting
	- alternative fasting , sometimes do one meal a day, sometimes do a full fast, other times do 16h intermittent fasting
- Exasome
	- One thousandth the size of a cell
	- Secreted by a stem cell
		- Stem cell is an undifferentiated cell (unspecialized)
		- Sends exasome to send a message to another damaged cell so that it can repair itself 
	- exasomes focused on by the guy talking:
		- More for cosmetics
		- Rich in: (18:37)
		- Hyleronic acid
			- In your joints
			- Wd40 of joints
		- Collagen type 1 and type 3
		- Elastin
		- Growth phisers?
		- Peptide LL37, antibacterial, anti microbial.
			- Works on acne
	- Put on skin in a variety of ways (topically )
		- Inserted to micro injuries on skin
		- 
	- Bind to receptors on cells, even if inflamed 
- Where do stem cells come from
	- Different types of stem cells: fat, bone marrow, brain
	- what are the most abundant stem cells
	- Umbilical cord stem cells are the best stem cells
	- Harvest the umbilical cord to get good stem cells
	- It’s very important the nutrients you give the stems cells once in pétri dishes
	- 
- Exasomes can come from any cell in the body, used to communicate 
- stem cell nutrients
	- Figuring out what to feed stem cells to limit aging (telomere degradation )
	- caloric restriction 
	- Low glucose
- stem cell production 
	- Harvest stem cell from umbilical cord
	- Put it in pétri dish with nutrients
	- Nutrients are type of keto diet
	- Certain type of stress the cell is under produce exasomes associated with high molecular weight Heyleronic acid
	- Once the cells are about 15 years biological age freeze them before transport for applying for use
- Where will we see stem cells for anti aging
	- Clinical studies ongoing to get drug approval
	- goal is to have off-the-shelf stem cells
- We know that their specialized Stem cells can help regulate immune system
	- Immediate immune response:
		- natural killer (NK) cells
		- Macrophages
		- Neutrophils
		- Dendritic cells
	- Secondary (larger) immune response:
		- T-Cells, either 
			- Pro-inflammatory
			- Regulatory - most important 
				- Regulates balance of inflammation 
			- Suppressor
			- Anti-inflammatory 
		- B-Cells
		- Either 
- Lots of autoimmune diseases right now
	- Water (microplastics and toxins)
	- in air
	- In food
		- What is organic really?
		- How can you vet organic food
	- Mitigate environmental factors
	- Do diagnostic testing
- Testing:
	- Heavy metals
	- microplastics 
	- Molds
- Want to identify and eliminate sources of toxins before trying to use stem cells
- Improve immune system and slow aging
	- Sunlight vitamin D
		-  Nothing more important than that
- you can spend all day in the sun but not get vitamin D because you got gut problems
- Other countries have more advanced medical tech (better than [[United States|USA]]), typically due to regulatory delays 
	- Mexico
	- Columbia
	- Panama
- Studying senescent cells for 8 years
	- NK cells are first responders to
		- Virus
		- Mutated cell (cancer)
		- Senescent cell
	- We can remove these cells in immune system using NK cells
		- take some NK cells outside body
		- Grow NK cells outside of you to train them to remove senescence 
		- Activate cells
		- Put them back in you
	- When senescence cells are gone, healthy cells are triggered to produce new healthy cells as replacements 
	- Every day we lose 300 billion cells
		- Mostly red blood cells but still a lot
- peptides can be put in joints 
- frozen umbilical cords can be used for babies who get cancer/diseases
- Blood stem cells are different than all the rest because they are super difficult to multiply 
	- Patients with cardiovascular issues have extra stem cells floating in their blood than normal, but signals are not there for them the heal things
- If you really want to experience stem cell therapy right now, you have to go outside the [[United States|USA]]
- current FDA stem cell guidelines (if cells used systematically then they are considered drugs and are not yet approved)
	- Homologous: put to the same use as the type of stem cell (fat cell for fat)
	- Autologous: cells are from you
	- Minimal manipulation: cells cannot be altered in any way
- Bone marrow has 0.000001% stem cells
- Point of tapping bone marrow cells
	- Only got a few stem cells, but other cells are there that are healing
	- immune Cells
	- Naive immune cells
	- Endothelial cells
- Summary
	- Fasting 
	- Improve immune system
	- Slowing the biological clock
- Sumamry
	- Think about what you put in your mouth
	- Get healthy before getting treatment/stem cell therapy
	- Get wide diagnostic testing
		- Bloodwork
		- Gut health - big percentage of immune system - affects immune systems
		- Advanced diagnostic 
			- catching cancer early
			- Full body  MRI scan
			- full body scan with prenoble
- What does it mean to you to be the ultimate himan
	- aging Gracefully 
	- Feeling fantastic 
	- S
	- Keep accelerating body to use its resources and not borrow from the future
