Determining when to Make vs. Outsource.

## Reasons for Making
- [[Direct Costs|Direct]], [[Indirect Costs|indirect]] and [[Indirect Costs|overhead]] costs are incurred regardless of whether item is outsourced
- [[Incremental Costs]] for producing an item are (in the short-term) less than the supplier's price.

## Relevant Making Costs (short-term)
- [[Incremental Costs]]
- [[Opportunity Cost]] of resources involved
    - this can be big if we could have otherwise been making other stuff more profitably
