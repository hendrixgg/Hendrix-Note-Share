***Interest*** is the difference between the amount of money lent and the amount of money later repaid in a loan agreement.

$P$ = principal amount = present worth = Amount of money today

$F$ = future amount = future worth = Amount of money some time in the future

$I$ = interest = (future amount) - (principal amount)

$i$ = interest rate = $\frac{I}{P}$ = $\frac{\text{interest}}{\text{principal amount}}$

$F = P + I$, and, $I = Pi$ 

$F = P(1 + i)$

## Interest Period
***interest period*** = the base unit of time over which an interest rate is calculated
- if you mention x% interest, it is assumed that you mean a 1 year period
