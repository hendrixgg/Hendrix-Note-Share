[[Cash Flow Diagrams]] can be complicated and irregular. Simplified models are used to be able to perform calculations upon them.

[[Discrete Cash Flow Models]] assume that all cash flows and all [[Compound Interest|compounding]] of [[Cash Flow Diagrams|Cash Flows]] occur at the end of conventionally defined periods. ([[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=132&selection=24,1,25,15|link]])

 [[Continuous Cash Flow Models]] assume [[Cash Flow Diagrams|Cash Flows]] and their [[Compound Interest|compounding]] occur continuously over time.
