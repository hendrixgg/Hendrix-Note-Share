Three components:
## 1 - [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS)
Define the work elements at successively finer detail. Also noting interrelationships.
## 2 - [[Cost and Revenue Structure]] (Classification)
Delineating the cost and revenue categories/elements and estimates of overall cash flow are made at each level of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]].
## 3 - [[Estimating Techniques (Models)]] (Modelling)
Select mathematical models to estimate the future costs and revenues.
## Integrate the 3 components

## Other Terms
- Cash flow perspective
    - which account/direction is positive/negative?
        - typically from owner's viewpoint
- estimating baseline
    - default amount of cashflow to compare against
        - could probably chose 0$ for the baseline 
        - perhaps there is a basic alternative that takes no effort and produces >0$ cash so you could pick that
- analysis period for cash flow 
    - start date and end date for analysis
    - determined by the project life cycle
