Basic tool of [[Project Management]].

guide: https://itpmschool.com/work-breakdown-structure-guide/
## Definition
source2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urT4R-cwX_M
A **deliverable-oriented** hierarchical decomposition of the total work to be delivered by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

## See Also
- [[Work Breakdown Structure Framework]]
- [[Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary]]
- [[Work Implementation Plan]]
## Representations

1. Graphical
2. Hierarchical List
3. Tabular List

## Core Characteristics
- coding/ID for each [[Work Element]]

> when you do the tabular list, then you can keep track of all the properties related to each [[Work Element]].

> If something is not in the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] then it's not in the project.

> Good communication tool.

3 main elements:
- end product
- deliverable
    - Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that must be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.
- [[Work Package]]
    - finished piece of a deliverable
    - should complete in the reporting period of the project
    - 2 weeks per work package

> All [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] elements should be tangible finished pieces of the [[Project Scope]].

> Tasks and activities are not part of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]].

Tasks and activities are actually separate from (but can be combined with) the [[Work Breakdown Structure]].

need 2 representations:
- table -> transform into dictionary ([[Work Breakdown Structure Dictionary]])
- diagram/hierarchical list

Constructing a [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] is an iterative process.

## Rules
1. A [[Work Breakdown Structure]] should only contain elements that are defined using nouns and adjectives - not verbs
2. All deliverables must be included. Include internal, external, and interim project management deliverables.
    1. work required to make [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] should go on the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]
3. All child elements must cover 100% of the scope of the parent deliverable
4. All [[Work Element]]s have a code/ID and it is used everywhere

## How to use
when planning
when clarifying scope. Just point to an item and ask questions about it.


## Purpose
- define all project [[Work Element]] and their interrelationships.
- collecting and organizing information
-  developing relevant cost and revenue data
-  integrating project management activities (see [[An Integrated Approach to Cost-Estimation|integrated approach]])

## Example

## Components
- functional/planning [[Work Element|work elements]]
    - logistical support
    - [[Project Management|project management]]
    - marketing
    - engineering
    - systems integration
- physical/foundational [[Work Element|work elements]]
    - labor
    - materials
    - procurement of resources
    - manufacturing/construction
- The content and resource requirements for a [[Work Element]] are the sum of the activities and the resource requirements of related [[Work Element|subelements]] below it
- A project WBS typically includes both recurring and nonrecurring [[Work Element|work elements]].
