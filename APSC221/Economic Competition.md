Most general economic principles are stated for situations where $perfect$ $competition$ exists.

#### Perfect competition
A situation in which: 
- any given product is supplied by a large number of vendors
- there is no restriction on additional suppliers entering the market.

#### (Coerced) Monopoly
- a unique product or service is only available from a ***single supplier***
- that vendor can ***prevent the entry*** of all others into the market.
