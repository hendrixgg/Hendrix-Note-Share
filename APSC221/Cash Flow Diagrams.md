We recommend using a cash flow diagram when working on a problem where cash flows occur at different times. 

Going through the steps of setting up a cash flow diagram can make the problem structure appear clearer. 

Sometimes, seeing the pattern of cash flows in the completed diagram gives a better “feel” for the problem. 

## Key Properties
1. Cash flows occur at the end of a period.
2. End of Period $i$ is the start of Period $i+1$.
3. "Now" is Time Zero ("0")
