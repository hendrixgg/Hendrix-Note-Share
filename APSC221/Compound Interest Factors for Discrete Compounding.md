The 4![[Cash Flow Diagrams#Common Cash Flow Patterns]]
and their associated [[Compound Interest Factors]]
1. [[Compound Interest Factors for Single Disbursements or Receipts]]
2. [[Compound Interest Factors for Annuities]]
3. [[Conversion Factor for Arithmetic Gradient Series]]
4. [[Conversion Factors for Geometric Gradient Series]]

## Tools
- [[Interest Factor Table.xlsx]]
- [[Compound Interest Solver.xlsx]]
## Key Assumptions
1. Compounding periods are of equal length. 
2. Each disbursement and receipt occurs at the end of a period. A payment at time 0 can be considered to occur at the end of period - 1. 
3. Annuities and gradients coincide with the ends of sequential periods. ([[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=148&selection=4,0,5,13|Section 7]] suggests several methods for dealing with annuities and gradients that do not coincide with the ends of sequential periods.)
