Use the project life cycle and and [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]].

Brief listing of cost categories:
1. [[Investment Cost|Capital Investment]] (fixed and working) 
2. Labor costs 
3. Material costs 
4. Maintenance costs 
5. Property taxes and insurance 
6. [[Indirect Costs|Overhead]] costs 
7. Disposal costs 
8. Revenues based on sales, etc. 
9. Quality (and scrap) costs 
10. Market (or salvage) values

Most severe errors come from overlooking cost categories and revenues. Good ways to solve this: ***tabular*** or ***checklist*** forms for the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]. 

You also need technical familiarity with the project to ensure the completeness of the structure.
