The estimation of cash flows for each alternative in an engineering decision.

must take into account future cash flows.

estimation of:
- costs, 
- revenues, 
- useful lives, 
- residual values, and 
- other data pertaining to the alternatives being analyzed

## ***cost estimating*** is used for:
1. quoting/contracts
2. figuring out if something will be profitable
3. justify capex for process changes
4. benchmark productivity improvement programs

Two approaches:
- Top-Down
    - based on similar past engineering projects
    - use historical data and modify to fit current times
    - use early in estimating when you don't know all the options yet
- Bottom-Up
    - more detailed
    - breaks the project down into small units
    - estimates economics for each smaller unit
    - use when details for project outputs are well defined
