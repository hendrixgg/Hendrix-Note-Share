## Nominal Interest Rate
conventional interest rate as stated in [[Compound and Simple Interest]]

## Effective Interest Rate
- $T$ = interest period ([[Interest and Interest Rates#Interest Period|link]])
- $m$ = number of equal subperiods
- $r$ = nominal interest rate
- $i_s = r/m$ = interest rate for each subperiod
- $F = P(1 + i_s)^m$ = future worth after compounding over 1 interest period
- $F = P(1 + i_e)$, $i_e =$ effective interest rate
- $(1 + i_s)^m = (1 + i_e)$
- $i_e = (1 + r/m)^m - 1$ = ***==effective interest rate==***
