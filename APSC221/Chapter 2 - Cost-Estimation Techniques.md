The cost of doing business must include:
- surveillance, 
- maintenance, 
- and safe closure of contaminated facilities

Costs have to cover the entire [[Life-Cycle Cost]] of a project.

When estimating costs for an entire [[project]], you will often need a [[Work Breakdown Structure]] so you can estimate the costs associated with each element of work.

When using a cost estimating model, you always have to use logic and reason to determine whether that model makes sense to use given the scenario.
