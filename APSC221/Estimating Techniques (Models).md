## Purpose
Develop cash flow estimates for each design alternative.
## Classifying estimates
![[Pasted image 20240511150613.png]]
1. Order-of-magnitude
    1. used for planning and initial evaluation stage
    2. accuracy $\pm$ 30-50%
    3. conferences, questionnaires, generalized equations
    4. applied at level 1/2 of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]
3. Semidetailed, or budget
    1. used in preliminary/conceptual design stage
    2. accuracy $\pm$ 15%
    3. applied at levels 2/3 of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]
5. Definitive (detailed)
    1. accuracy $\pm$ 5%
    2. used as basis for bids (for contracts) and in detailed engineering/construction stages
    3. from specifications, drawings, site surveys, vendor quotations, in-hous historical records
    4. applied at level 3 or below of the [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]]


## Factors that go into estimates
1. Time and effort available as justified by the importance of the study 
2. Difficulty of estimating the items in question 
3. Methods or techniques employed 
4. Qualifications of the estimator(s) 
5. Sensitivity of study results to particular factor estimates

## Sources of Estimating Data
1. Accounting records
2. Other sources within the firm
3. Sources outside the firm

## How Estimates are Accomplished

1. A conference
2. Comparison/Analogy
3. Using quantitative techniques
