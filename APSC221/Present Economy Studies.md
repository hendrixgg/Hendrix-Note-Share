When alternatives for accomplishing a specific task are being compared over a *one year or less* period and the influence of time on money can be ignored (insignificant interest).

### Rule 1 - Maximize Profitability
When revenues and other economic benefits are present and vary among alternatives, choose the alternative that ***maximizes*** overall profitability based on the *number of defect-free* units of a product or service produced.
> This is short-term focused. In the case of an industry where having more of your products in the market (higher market share) is valuable, then you may want to maximize number of units produced (while continually working on reducing costs). Example is Tesla where having more vehicles on the road means more training data for self-driving software which will produce future recurring revenues. more vehicles (EV) also mean fewer (ICE) and less direct pollution. More vehicles also brings more brand recognition and is an effective form of marketing.

### Rule 2 - Minimize Costs
When revenues and other economic benefits are ***not present*** or are ***constant*** among all alternatives, consider *only the costs* and select the alternative that ***minimizes*** total cost.
> Yes, minimizing costs is always good, as long as quality is maintained.
