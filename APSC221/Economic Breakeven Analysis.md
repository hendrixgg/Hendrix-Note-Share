Total Cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs ---> $C_T = C_F + C_V$

**Assuming** linear relationship: $C_V = c_v\cdot D$

$c_v$ = variable cost per unit

Two scenarios:
- demand function of price
- demand and price independent

#### Scenario 1 Demand function of price
$p$ depends on Demand: $p = a - b \cdot D$

max profit: $D^* = \frac{a - c_v}{2b}$

breakeven: $-bD^2 + (a-c_v)D - C_F = 0$ (solve quadratic)

This is used to model high-cost businesses, usually niche and specialized businesses.
#### Scenario 2 Demand and Price are Independent
$p$ is an independent variable and $p > c_v$ .

For a constant $p$, we get a single breakeven point.

- $\text{TR} = p \cdot D$
- $C_T = C_F + c_v \cdot D$
- $D^\prime = \frac{C_F}{p - c_v}$
