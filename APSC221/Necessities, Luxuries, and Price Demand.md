Price demand is being modeled linearly based on the selling price of the product.

- b = demand increase per unit decrease in p
- a = intercept of the demand curve on price axis
- D = "demand" ***or*** number of units sold

> Note that this is not how demand works in practice, as it is often a non-linear relationship where a linear decrease in price correlates with an exponential increase in demand. The linear model is accurate for locally small changes in price. (My added note)
