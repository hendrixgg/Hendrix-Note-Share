Condition that exists when the value of a cost at one time is equivalent to the value of the related benefit received at a different time

Types of equivalence
- [[Mathematical Equivalence]]
- [[Decisional Equivalence]]
- [[Market Equivalence]]

## Key Assumption
- [[Market Equivalence]] is true
    - in reality, each [[transaction]] has administrative overhead. So cash flows with fewer transactions may be viewed as more valuable than cash flows of the same amount but with more transactions.
- [[Decisional Equivalence]] is monetarily quantifiable
