Where the [[Effective and Nominal Interest Rates#Effective Interest Rate|Effective interest rate]] is calculated using $m$ (number of compounding periods) which is infinitely large.

$i_e = \lim_{m\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m - 1$

using $\lim_{m\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^m = e^r$ which is the natural exponential.

$i_e = e^r - 1$

most of the time this is not used due the the increased work to do the calculations. Discrete compounding is used (m is finite).
