## Compound Interest
Paying interest on the principal and accrued interest value.
- $P$ = lending amount
- $N$ = number of interest periods
- $i$ = interest rate over a single interest period
- $F = P(1 + i)^N$ = amount repaid after $N$ periods
- $I_c = P(1 + i)^N - P$ = Compound Interest
- compounding period = period of time for interest to be calculated

## Simple Interest
Paying interest only on the principal.
- $I_s = PiN$ = Simple Interest
- interest earned during an interest period is not added to the principal amount
- mentioned only to contrast with compound interest
