A CER is a mathematical model that describes the cost of an engineering project as a function of one or more ==design variables==.

Allow for estimates to be made early in design process before detailed information is available

Four basic steps in developing a CER: 
1. Problem definition [[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=73&selection=50,1,51,16|link]]
    1. [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] is a good way to break problem down
2. Data collection and normalization [[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=73&selection=61,0,61,32|link]]
    1. [[Work Breakdown Structure|WBS]] is a good way to organize data
3. CER equation development [[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=73&selection=79,0,80,0|link]]
    1. plot and see which equation form is good (linear, power, log, exponential)
    2. linearize and do [[linear regression]] [[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=74&selection=202,0,361,1|link]]
4. Model validation and documentation [[(APSC221) Economics & Business Practices in Engineering - 2022 version.pdf#page=77&selection=37,0,43,12|link]]
    1. Standard error (SE) (want small)
    2. Correlation Coefficient (R) (want closer to $\pm$ 1.0)
    3. document data sets and normalization methods

benefits:
- given the required input data, they are quick and easy to use
- usually requires very little detailed information, making it possible to use the CER early in the design process
- excellent predictor of cost if correctly developed from good historical data.
