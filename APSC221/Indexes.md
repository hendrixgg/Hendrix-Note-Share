Dimensionless values used to estimate relationships of the of the past or future relative to a defined reference point.

They are metrics used to quantify relativistic variables.
- changes in technology or economies of scale
- scarcity or abundance of resources

Example: Consumer Price Index (CPI)

## Composite Indexes
Created by averaging the ratios of multiple items over time.

Weighted Index:

- M = total number of items in the index ($1 \leq m \leq M$)
- $C_{nm} =$ unit cost (or price) of the $m$th item in year $n$
- $C_{km} =$ unit cost (or price) of the $m$th item in year $k$
- $W_m =$ weight assigned to the $m$th item
- $\bar I_k =$ composite index value in the year k

Weights usually sum up to 1.00 or 100, but they could sum up to anything.
