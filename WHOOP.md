## Reasons to keep
decision: yes
- it's easier to maintain good habits
    - because it tracks how you are doing
    - and you can know how you are doing

## Issues
- default band keeps giving me a rash, possible causes:
	- Material
	- Letting it be wet after a shower/sweating
		- I’m thinking it’s a combination of this and not cleaning and the soap inside the watch band. I’m going to take off the watch during a shower, and ensure that it is cleaned thoroughly once per week.
		- If this doesn’t work, then I am getting a new silicone watch band which costs 118 $ with tax and shipping. Maybe I can buy a 3rd party watch band for cheaper?
	- Not cleaning enough
	- Soap chemicals residing inside the watch band after shower
